## 🔄 Security Update Process

### Vulnerability Assessment
1. **Discovery**: Internal testing or external report
2. **Triage**: Severity assessment (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
4. **Remediation**: Patch development and testing
5. **Deployment**: Coordinated security update release
6. **Communication**: Stakeholder notification

### Security Patch Priority
```
Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0): 24 hours
High (CVSS 7.0-8.9):     72 hours
Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9):   1 week
Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9):      2 weeks
```
